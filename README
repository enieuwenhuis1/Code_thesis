MATHEMATICAL MODEL MULTIPLE MYELOMA
The goal was to make fraction and number models that simulate the interactions
between four cell types in the MM microenvironment: drug-sensitive MM cells
(MMd), resistant MM cells (MMr), osteoblasts (OB) and osteoclasts (OC). All
models used collective interactions and were made in the framework of evolutionary
game theory. The models were utilised to determine the effect of traditional and
adaptive therapy and to study the impact of different inhibitor (IH) strengths,
administration durations and holiday durations on the cell type. In addition,
the IH holiday duration, administration duration and strength were optimised.

To better understand MM microenvironment modelling, the figures from Sartakhti et
al. (2018) (nonlinear) and Sartakhti et al. (2016) (linear) were first attempted
to be reproduced. Both papers did not disclose their code, hence comparison of
the results was not possible.


PYTHON AND LIBRARY VERSION
The models were written in Python code (version 3.11.4) using Atom (version 1.60.0).
Some libraries must be installed to run the codes in the code folder.

changing N. It contains code to make figures showing the effect of the WMMd IH,
MMd GF IH and IH combination on the cell fractions for different administration
periods and strengths. It also contains an optimisation to find the best holiday
