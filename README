The goal was to make a model that simulates the dynamics of the multiple myeloma
(MM) microenvironment to determine the effects of several treatments and resistance
levels. A model is ideally for this because it generates results fast, it is cheap
and easy reproducible. There is looked at three cell types: MM cells, osteoblasts
(OBs) and osteoclasts (OCs). The model simulates a public goods game in the framework
of evolutionary game theory with collective interactions and nonlinear benefits.
The impact of the following treatments was studied: ....

PYTHON AND LIBRARY VESIONS
Python version 3.11.4 is used.
To run the codes in the code file some libraries need to be installed.

THE MODEL WITH LINEAR BENFITS: model_S_linear.py
model_S_linear.py contains code of the mathematical EGT formulas
as wel as code to reproduce some of the figures in the paper: Evolutionary dynamics
of Tumor-Stroma interactions in multiple myeloma by Sartakhti et al., 2016. Here
the benefits are linear and there are collective interactions.

TEST THE CODE
To test the functions in the model, doc tests are added and automatically run when
the model_S_linear.py code is run.


THE MODEL WITH NONLINEAR BENEFITS: model_S_nonlinear.py
Model_S_nonlinear.py contains the code with all the mathematical EGT formulas as
well as the code to reproduce the figures from the paper: Game Theory of Tumor–Stroma
Interactions in Multiple Myeloma: Effect of Nonlinear Benefits by Sartakhti et al.,
2018. It shows the effect of nonlinear benefits compared to linear benefits. There
are collective interactions.

TEST THE CODE
To test the functions in the model, doc tests are added and automatically run when
the cancer_model.py code is run.

THE DATA
The folder data contains all the generated data that is used to make the figures and
to perform the statistical tests. This folder contains:
* reproduced_data_Sartakhti_nonlinear: contains all the data used for the figure
                                reproduction in the paper of Sartakhti et al., 2016
* reproduced_data_Sartakhti_linear: contains all the data used for the figure
                                reproduction in the paper of Sartakhti et al., 2016

THE FIGURES
In the folder visualisation all made figures are shown. This folder contains:
* reproduced_results_Sartakhti_nonlinear: contains all the reproduced figures of
                                        the paper of Sartakhti et al., 2018.
* reproduced_results_Sartakhti_linear: contains all the reproduced figures of the
                                      paper of Sartakhti et al., 2016.
