MATHEMATICAL MULTIPLE MYELOMA MODEL
The goal was to make a fraction model and a number model that simulate the dynamics
of the multiple myeloma (MM) microenvironment and determine the effect of adaptive
therapy versus traditional therapy. During adaptive therapy the drugs are
administered in short periods with holidays in between and during traditional
therapy the MTD is continuously administered. The models looked at the interactions
via diffusible factors between four cell types: drug-sensitive MM cells (MMd),
resistant MM cells (MMr), osteoblasts (OBs) and osteoclasts (OCs). Both models
simulate a public goods game in the framework of evolutionary game theory with
collective interactions. The impact of an MMd GF inhibitor (IH) and a WMMd IH on
the cell type fractions and numbers are studied for different strengths,
administration durations and holiday durations.

To better understand MM microenvironment modelling, the figures from Sartakhti et
al. (2018) (nonlinear) and Sartakhti et al. (2016) (linear) were first attempted
to be reproduced. Both papers did not disclose their code, hence comparison of
the interpretation was not possible.
