MATHEMATICAL MODEL MULTIPLE MYELOMA
The goal was to make fraction and number models that simulate the interactions
between four cell types In the MM microenvironment: drug-sensitive MM cells (MMd),
resistant MM cells (MMr), osteoblasts (OBs) and osteoclasts (OCs). All models
used collective interactions and were made in the framework of evolutionary game
theory. The models were utilised to determine the effect of traditional therapy and
adaptive therapy to study the impact of the inhibitors (IHs) on the cell type
fractions and numbers for different strengths, administration durations and
holiday durations. In addition, the IH holiday duration, administration duration
and strength were optimised.

To better understand MM microenvironment modelling, the figures from Sartakhti et
al. (2018) (nonlinear) and Sartakhti et al. (2016) (linear) were first attempted
to be reproduced. Both papers did not disclose their code, hence comparison of
the interpretation was not possible.
