The goal was to make a model that simulates the dynamics of the multiple myeloma
(MM) microenvironment to determine the effects of several treatments and resistance
levels. A model is ideally for this because it generates results fast, it is cheap
and easy reproducible. There is looked at three cell types: MM cells, osteoblasts
(OBs) and osteoclasts (OCs). The model simulates a public goods game in the framework
of evolutionary game theory with collective interactions and nonlinear benefits.
The impact of the following treatments was studied: ....

PYTHON AND LIBRARY VESIONS
Python version 3.11.4 is used.
To run the codes in the code file some libraries need to be installed.

cancer_model.py:
* numpy (version 1.26.0)
    - install: pip install numpy==1.26.0

data_visualisation.py:
* numpy (version 1.26.0)
    - install: pip install numpy==1.26.0
* matplotlib (version 3.8.0)
    - install: pip install matplotlib==3.8.0
* pandas (version 2.1.3)
    - install: pip install pandas==2.1.3
* ternary (version 0.1)
    - install: pip install ternary==0.1
* plotly (version 5.18.0)
    - install: pip install plotly==5.18.0


THE MODEL: cancer_model.py
Cancer_model.py contains the code to reproduce the results of the paper: Game Theory
of Tumor–Stroma Interactions in Multiple Myeloma: Effect of Nonlinear Benefits by
Sartakhti et al., 2018). It shows the effect of nonlinear benefits compared to linear
benefits.

TEST THE CODE
To test the functions in the model, doc tests are added and automatically run when
the cancer_model.py code.

THE DATA
The folder data contains all the generated data that is used to make the figures and
to perform the statistical tests. This folder contains a folder named reproduced_
data_Sartakhti with all the reproduced data of the paper of Sartakhti et al., 2018
and a folder named ... with ...

THE VISUALISATION
Data_visualisation.py contains the code to make all the used figures. The data
utilised for the figures is generated with cancer_model.py.

In the folder visualisation all made figures are shown. This folder contains a folder
named reproduced_results_Sartakhti with all the reproduced figures of the paper of
Sartakhti et al., 2018 and a folder named ... with ....

THE STATISTICAL TESTS
Statistics_tests.py contains all the statistical test that are performed on the data
generated with cancer_model.py.

HOW TO RUN
The model, cancer_model:
         - python cancer_model.py

The visualisation, data_visualisation.py:
         - python data_visualisation.py

The tests, statistics_tests.py:
         - python statistics_tests.py
