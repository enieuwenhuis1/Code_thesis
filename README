The goal was to make a model that simulates dynamics in the multiple myeloma (MM)
microenvironment with three cell types: MM cells, osteoblasts (OBs) and osteoclasts
(OCs). The model simulates a public goods game in in the framework of evolutionary
game theory with collective interactions and nonlinear benefits. The model was used
to determine the effects of several treatment on the multiple myeloma and to investigate
the effects of resistance development.

PYTHON AND LIBRARY VESIONS  
Python version 3.11.4 is used. To run the different codes in the code file some
libraries need to be installed.

cancer_model.py
* numpy (version 1.26.0)
    - install: pip install numpy==1.26.0
* matplotlib (version 3.8.0)
    - install: pip install matplotlib==3.8.0
* pandas (version 2.1.3)
    - install: pip install pandas==2.1.3
* seabron (version 0.13.0)
    - install: pip install seaborn==0.13.0
* ternary (version 0.1)
    - install: pip install ternary==0.1
* plotly (version 5.18.0)
    - install: pip install plotly==5.18.0

THE MODEL: cancer_model.py
Cancer_model.py contains the code to reproduce the results of the paper: Game Theory
of Tumorâ€“Stroma Interactions in Multiple Myeloma: Effect of Nonlinear Benefits by
Sartakhti et al., 2018). It shows the effect of nonlinear benefits compared to linear
benefits.

HOW TO RUN
The model:
      python cancer_model.py
